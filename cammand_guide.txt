When Pi is running, the mushroom service will run automatically.
When you need to config or run your code you need to stop the service first!


#for checking the service status
$ journalctl -u mushroom.service -f

#for stop service
$ sudo systemctl stop mushroom.service

#for set environment and run main code (without display)(headless)
$ source /home/ussy/venv/bin/activate && python /home/ussy/main_mushroom.py

#for set environment and run main code (with display)(gui)(can work only you connect monitor/remote)
$ source /home/ussy/venv/bin/activate && python /home/ussy/main_mushroom_viewer.py
